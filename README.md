#### Data Engineering

Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files including data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other required constraints.
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

Create an SQL file and analyse data to obtain the following information: 

Employees list 
Employees hired in 1986
List of managers for each department
List of departments for each employee
List of all employees that have first name "Hercules" and their last names begin with "B"
List of all employees in the Sales department
List of all employees in the Sales and Development departments
Frequency count of employee last names, in descending order

## Pandas Analysis
